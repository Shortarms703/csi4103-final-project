# CSI 4103 Final Project

Comparing the performance of model training with forward vs back propagation in calculating the gradients.

The [training_time_graphs.ipynb](training_time_graphs.ipynb) is the file run to produce the graphs in the report. 

The [FNN_single_layer_parameterized.py](FNN_single_layer_parameterized.py) contains our simple neural network implementation. 

The tests are included in the folder [tests](tests) and are run with pytest. 

The [FNN_multiple_layer_parameterized.py](FNN_multiple_layer_parameterized.py) file was not used.
